# Smart Contracts and Multi-Sig Wallets

## Multi-Sig Wallets

On the algorand blockchain, we own a [multi-signature wallet](https://developer.algorand.org/docs/get-details/transactions/signatures/?from_query=multi%20sig#multisignatures), which is controlled by the validators.

When validators reach a consensus on whether or not to release a transfer, they ping the wallet, which releases a users assets.

## Smart Contracts

On the ethereum blockchain, we have an identical architecture, however, the contracts are custom, as ethereum does not enable built-in multi-sig wallets, like algorand. So we built our own, with solidity.
