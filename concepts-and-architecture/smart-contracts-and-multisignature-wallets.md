# Smart Contracts and Multi-Sig Wallets

## Multi-Sig Wallets

On the algorand blockchain, we own a [multi-signature wallet](https://developer.algorand.org/docs/get-details/transactions/signatures/?from_query=multi%20sig#multisignatures), which is controlled by the validators.

When validators reach a consensus on whether or not to release a transfer, they ping the wallet, which releases a users assets.

## Smart Contracts

On the ethereum blockchain, we have an identical architecture. 

The difference here, is that ethereum has slightly more flexibility language wise, than algorand allows, and so we have developed an optimised multi-sig wallet on ethereum, which incorporates governance into the internal methods.
