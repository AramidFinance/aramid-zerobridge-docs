# Tokenomics and Token-Engineering

For complex eco-systems with many intelligent agents, it is useful to model a token and the crypto-economics that it is built with. For this, we are using [TokenSPICE](https://github.com/tokenspice).

> TokenSPICE simulates tokenized ecosystems via an agent-based approach, with EVM in-the-loop.
> > More simply, we create dummy actors, and give them roles such as: `staker` or `validator` within an eco-system, and then let some clever maths and computing play out how people(?) buy and sell their tokens.

The goal here is the figure out, with some computational assurance, how best to build a sustainable crypto-eco-system.
