# Security

## Audit

We are currently going through a security audit for our Relayer Application and Smart Contracts, led by [Kudelski](https://kudelskisecurity.com/?msclkid=d565f439add311ec87d88ff3b56e6baa) Security.&#x20;

All details will be posted here within the first or second week of November 2022.

## Active monitoring

We are currently integrating Chainlinks [`Proof-Of-Reserve`](https://chain.link/proof-of-reserve) where available (currently EVM chains),  aswell as a similar solution for Algorand built by Kudelsky Security, enabling us to detect deviations and pausing contracts in the case of a security issue.&#x20;

## Security Policies

Implementing and enforcing security policies dramatically reduce the risk of attacks and prepare for the worst case. In the past several bridge hacks have been highly succesful due to missing security policies, for example Wormhole (vulnerability fix was not deployed to production for over a month after the fix was shared to the public repository) or Ronin Bridge (vulnerability was only closed 7 days after being identified due to missing controls to stop the draining of funds).&#x20;

**Access Controls**: Access controls determine the allowed activities of legitimate users to access system resources. By exercising access controls one can specify what users can do, which resources they can access and what operations they can perform on a system. User authentication and access management are authorization structure controls which are not monolithic, rather granular and adaptive based on contextual information and predefined conditions. Access control systems offer different levels of confidentiality, integrity, and availability to the user, the system and the organisation assets.

**Security Operations**: Security operations such as asset management, change management, assessments, and awareness training, identify an organization’s information assets and document the processes required for the implementation of policies, standards, and frameworks that ensure the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of these assets. Having visibility into your organisation assets allows security teams to be aware of what they are to protect.

**Risk Identification, Monitoring, and Analysis**: Organizations face a wide range of security challenges today, including expanding risks to organizational assets and customer data. Understanding and managing these risks are integral components of a successful corporate security program. Identifying risks to information systems and developing and implementing controls to mitigate the identified risks are the cornerstones of an enterprise-wide risk management process.

**Incident Response and Recovery**: Planning for unexpected events is an act of prudence. Organizations must plan and be prepared to act during an incident or a breach. Incident response and business continuity planning can assist an organization to navigate safely through the troubled waters of a security incident back to normal operations. As such, incident response and business continuity are complementary to each other. Proper contingency planning and incident response are vital for an organization’s survival.

**Cryptography**: Cryptography is a “must-have” for every organization as it is plugged into the overall framework of confidentiality, integrity, and availability. Encryption is the foundation of keeping data confidential and it is no wonder that is the single measure mentioned in all regulations and jurisdictions. Encryption also helps ensure the authenticity of two communicating parties’, whether humans or devices, machines. Hashes and digital certificates are used to verify the integrity of streamed data. Finally, cryptography impacts the availability of data through the introduction of extra risk due to the loss or compromise of cryptographic keys.
