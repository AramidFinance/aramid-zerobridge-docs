### Blockchains: A Quick Overview

A blockchain is a distributed, immuatable, ledger. A history of communication between parties. 

The blockchain ecosystem has grown considerably in the last decade with proliferation of decentralized applications (DApps) with use-cases such as Digital Identity, Decentralized Finance (DeFi), Gaming, Non Fungible Tokens (NFTs) and many more. 

The growth of these blockchains have not been uniform. For example, the Ethereum ecosystem has grown considerably in last few years with many DApps across many business domains. However, for others, it has not been so stellar. These blockchains provide benefits and challenges unique to themselves. For example, the cost of executing transactions in Ethereum is very high. In addition, there are challenges with the scalability of the network. 

On the other hand, Algorand, a non-EVM Layer-1 blockchain, has very low transaction fee and higher throughput. Similarly, Polygon, a Layer-2 scaling solution, also has low transaction cost. However, these blockchains and DApps exist as silos and there is very little interaction among them.

This is where bridges come in.

### What is a Bridge?

Under the hood, a bridge is a communication protocol. It is an automated software system which listens for information changes in one blockchain, and relays them to a second blockchain. 

These changes are manifested in our bridge as moving assets from one chain to another. If someone holds a Token, say in Ethereum network, they can take advantage of higher APR in a deFi application in Algorand blockchain by sending assets from Ethereum to Algorand chain.

### Main Features of our Bridge

* Seamless user interaction
* Supports both EVM and AVM chains
* Cryptographically secure
* Permissionless transfers
* Decentralised architecture
