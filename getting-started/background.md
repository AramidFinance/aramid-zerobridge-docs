# Introduction

![](../.gitbook/assets/aramid-bridge.png)

Aramid is a community owned decentralized cross chain bridge, which enables users to transfer their liquidity across multiple networks to maximize their experience of different dApps built on different chains. Aramid uses decentralized liquidity networks to enable transfer of assets from one blockchain to another. The features of Aramid are as following:

* Fully decentralized Bridging experience&#x20;
* Can be used to bridge multiple assets across multiple blockchains&#x20;
* Trusted Decentralized relayer node network&#x20;
* Lucrative returns to liquidity providers against their investment Farming, Staking and liquidity provision opportunities for stakeholders to participate in the network and earn lucrative yields
* &#x20;Platform to list new tokens and bootstrap their liquidity from trusted Aramid community Apart from providing seamless bridging experience to users, protocol has a community owned governance mechanism where community members can participate and contribute to improve the operational mechanics of protocol. Governance helps protocol to adopt the market dynamics and make changes in the protocol through consensus of community

### Blockchains: A Quick Overview

A blockchain is a distributed, immuatable, ledger. A history of communication between parties.

The blockchain ecosystem has grown considerably in the last decade with proliferation of decentralized applications (DApps) with use-cases such as Digital Identity, Decentralized Finance (DeFi), Gaming, Non Fungible Tokens (NFTs) and many more.

Each blockchain provides benefits and challenges unique to itself. For example, whereas Ethereum was the first programmable blockchain, the cost of executing transactions in it is very high and there are challenges with the scalability of the network.

On the other hand, Algorand, a non-EVM Layer-1 blockchain, has very low transaction fee and higher throughput. Similarly, Polygon, a Layer-2 scaling solution, also has low transaction cost. However, these blockchains and DApps exist as silos and there is very little interaction among them.

This is where bridges come in.

### What is a Bridge?

Under the hood, a bridge is a communication protocol. It is an automated software system which listens for information changes in one blockchain, and relays them to a second blockchain.

These changes are manifested in our bridge as moving assets from one chain to another. If someone holds a Token, say in Ethereum network, they can take advantage of higher APR in a Defi application on the Algorand blockchain by sending assets from Ethereum to Algorand.

> Similar to the well known [blockchain trilemma](https://www.ledger.com/academy/what-is-the-blockchain-trilemma?msclkid=62401980b69311ecb1bce2942376c045), bridges also suffer from their [own trilemma](https://blog.connext.network/the-interoperability-trilemma-657c2cf69f17).

### Main Features of our Bridge

* Seamless user interaction.
* Supports both EVM and AVM chains.
* Cryptographically secure.
* Permissionless transfers.
* Decentralised architecture.
