# Introduction

**Aramid** is a decentralized cross chain communication protocol that allows transactions from evm to evm and evm to non-evm blockchains. Our current implementation supports 3-way communication among Ethereum, Algorand and Polygon chains and is deployed in respective TestNet environments.

### Main Features

* Evm and non-evm chain communication
* Seamless user interaction
* Trustless Protocol
* Cryptographically Secure
* Multi-Signature validation and on chain verification
* Non-Custodial

### Blockchain Ecosystem & Challenges

Blockchain ecosystem have grown considerably in the last decade with proliferation of  decentralized applications (DApp) such as Digital Identity, Decentralized Finance (DeFi), Gaming, Non Fungible Tokens (NFT) and others. Different blockchains use different smart contract languages, consensus protocols and DApps.&#x20;

The growth of these blockchains have not been uniform. Ethereum ecosystem has grown considerably in last few years with many DApps across many business domains. However, for others, it has not been so stellar.These blockchains provide benefits and challenges unique to themselves. For example, the cost of executing transactions in Ethereum is very high. In addition, there are challenges with the scalability of the network. On the other hand, Algorand, a non-EVM Layer-1 blockchain, has very low transaction fee and higher throughput. Similarly, Polygon, a Layer-2 scaling solution, also has low transaction cost. However, these blockchains and DApps exist as silos and there is very little interaction among them.

### Birth of Bridge

Bridges foster cross-chain communication, moving assets from one chain to other, helping to use DApps from another chain. If someone holds a Token, say in Ethereum network, they can take advantage of higher APR in a deFi application in Algorand blockchain by sending assets from Ethereum to Algorand chain.&#x20;
