# Introduction

### Bitcoin - a new era

In 2009, Bitcoin heralded a new era as the digital currency became a part of conducting business transactions. In May 2010, Florida-based Laszlo Hanyecz spent 10,000 Bitcoins to get two pizzas from a local pizza store called Papa John's. This transaction is known as the first official use of Bitcoin for a commercial transaction with an actual company.&#x20;

Bitcoin is a decentralized system that stores transactions in a distributed ledger called Blockchain. The transactions are cryptographically verified using a consensus protocol and immutable. The decentralization, immutability and security features became a foundation for new wave of applications.

### Ethereum and Smart Contracts

In 2013, Ethereum came up with Smart Contracts, also known as computer code, that allowed business logic to be coded into the transactions. The smart contract code was written using Solidity/Go languages and was executed in an Ethereum Virtal Machine (EVM) environment. Applications developed using smart contracts were called decentralized applications (DApp). The blockchain eco system grew considerably in the last decade with many new type of applications such as Digital Identity, Decentralized Finance (DeFi), Gaming, Non Fungible Tokens (NFT) and others.&#x20;

### Blockchain Ecosystem & Challenges

There have been many different blockchains that use different smart contract languages, consensus protocols and support DApps for various business domains. These blockchains have grown unevenly and provide different benefits and challenges. For example, the cost of executing transactions in Ethereum is very high. In addition, there have been challenges with the scalability of the network. On the otherhand, Algorand, a non-EVM Layer-1 blockchain, has a very low transaction fee and higher throughput. Similarly, Polygon, a Layer-2 scaling solution, also has low transaction cost. However, these blockchains and DApps exist as silos and there is very little interaction among them.&#x20;

### Birth of a Bridge

There is a strong need for cross-chain communication, moving assets from one chain to other to take advantage of the facilities available unique to a blockchain. Cross-chain communication will help accelerate the growth of Blockchain eco-system as a whole. Zero Bridge is at the forefront of this challenge and leads the way to make this a reality by integrating Ethereum, Algorand, Polygon and other EVM and non-EVM blockchains.
