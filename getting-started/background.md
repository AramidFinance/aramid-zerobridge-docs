# Background

In 2009, Bitcoin heralded a new era as it introduced digital currency to be a part of conducting business transactions. In May 2010, Florida-based Laszlo Hanyecz spent 10,000 Bitcoins to get two pizzas from a local pizza store called Papa John's. This transaction is known as the first official use of Bitcoin for a commercial transaction with an actual company.

In 2013, Ethereum came up with Smart Contracts, also known as computer code, that opened the door for various applications using Blockchain. The smart contract code was written using Solidity/Go language and was executed in an Ethereum Virtal Machine (EVM) environment.&#x20;

Immutability, decentralization, privacy and cryptology based security has led to proliferation of blokchains in the last decade. The blockchain eco system has grown considerably with many new type of applications such as Digital Identity, Decentralized Finance (DeFi), Gaming, Non Fungible Tokens (NFT) and others. But, current blockchain systems exist as silos and therefore, have evolved unevenly with Ethereum experiencing most growth. However, the cost of executing these transactions has become very high due to rise in price of Ethereum. In addition, there have been challenges with the scalability of the network. Other blockchains have solved this problem using different consensus algorithms and technology. For example, Algorand, a non-EVM Layer-1 blockchain, has a very low transaction fee and higher throughput. Similarly, Polygon is a Layer-2 scaling solution that also has low transaction cost.

There is a strong need for cross-chain communication, moving assets from one chain to other to take advantage of the facilities available unique to a blockchain. Cross-chain communication will help accelerate the growth of Blockchain eco-system as a whole. Zero Bridge is at the forefront of this challenge and leads the way to make this a reality by integrating Ethereum, Algorand, Polygon and other EVM and non-EVM blockchains.
