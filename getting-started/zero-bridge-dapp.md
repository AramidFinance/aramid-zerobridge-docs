### Currently supported bridging options&#x20;

The briding options have been separated into non-EVM to non-EVM, EVM to non-EVM and EVM to EVM - _Please consider the term EVM as EVM compatible in the docs context_.&#x20;

#### Non-EVM (focus on Algorand) to EVM (and viceversa) bridging:

Algorand to Ethereum \
Algorand to Polygon

#### EVM (a) to EVM (b) (and viceversa)&#x20;

Ethereum to Polygon

#### Non-EVM to non-EVM (and viceversa)

Zero Bridge allows bridging of Assets in Ethereum, Algorand and Polygon environment. Users can transfer ERC20 tokens from Ethereum to Algorand, Polygon to Algorand and vice versa. The ERC20 tokens from EVM compatible chains are transferred in Algorand Standard Assets (ASA) in Algorand.
