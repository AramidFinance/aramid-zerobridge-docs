# Zero Bridge

### Bridges and Challenges

Building Bridges is a challenge due to unique nature of languages and protocols used to implement a blockchain. Typically, blockchains are divided into two different categories: EVM compatibles and non-EVM chains. Among non-EVM chains, each of them are unique in their own way.&#x20;

Bridges connect two different decentralized systems to act as a cohesive whole. That means the first requirement for a Bridge is to be decentralized in nature. The next challenge is to bridge the language and consensus protocol gap. &#x20;

Zero Bridge is at the forefront of this challenge and leads the way to make this a reality by integrating Ethereum, Algorand, Polygon and other EVM and non-EVM blockchains.
